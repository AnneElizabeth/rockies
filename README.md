# Rockies

"The Rockies gem lists the current roster of pitchers playing for the Colorado Rockies and gives the user an option to retrieve more information about them."

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rockies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rockies

## Usage

The program will open with a list of current pitchers playing for the Colorado Rockies. Enter the number next to the name of the pitcher you'd like to know more about. You will see new information about the pitcher, including his jersey number, bat/throw position, height, weight, and birthdate. You may then enter another number to find out more about another pitcher, enter 'list' to see the list of pitchers, or enter 'exit' to leave the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
